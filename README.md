# Roadmap Multi-Agent System

## Project Overview

Welcome to the **Roadmap Multi-Agent System** repository, created as part of a 7-day GenAI challenge. This project showcases how multiple AI agents can collaborate to generate a comprehensive, structured learning roadmap for any given topic. The system is designed to be adaptable for a wide range of subjects, from beginner to advanced levels.

## How It Works

The system uses six specialized agents to generate different components of a roadmap. Each agent performs a specific role to ensure the roadmap is both thorough and easy to follow.

### Agents

1. **Overview Agent**
   - Provides an introductory overview of the chosen topic.
   - Explains the significance and high-level concepts to give a clear understanding.

2. **Core Concepts Agent**
   - Breaks down key concepts and principles essential for mastering the topic.
   - Delivers detailed explanations and examples to aid in comprehension.

3. **Tools & Resources Agent**
   - Recommends relevant tools, frameworks, libraries, and other resources.
   - Provides links and resources for hands-on learning.

4. **Learning Path Agent**
   - Generates a step-by-step learning path from beginner to advanced levels.
   - Includes milestones and links to educational resources.

5. **Challenges & Best Practices Agent**
   - Identifies common challenges faced by learners.
   - Offers best practices and actionable tips for overcoming obstacles.

6. **Advanced Topics Agent**
   - Suggests advanced concepts and specialized areas of study.
   - Offers resources to dive deeper into the subject.

### Tasks

Each agent is assigned a task to ensure the roadmap is comprehensive:

- **Overview Task**: Generate a high-level introduction to the topic.
- **Core Concepts Task**: Detail the fundamental principles and theories.
- **Tools Task**: Recommend tools, frameworks, and resources for hands-on practice.
- **Learning Path Task**: Create a step-by-step learning roadmap.
- **Challenges Task**: Identify learning challenges and suggest best practices.
- **Advanced Topics Task**: Explore cutting-edge topics for advanced learners.

### Downloadable Roadmap

The final roadmap generated by the system can be **downloaded as a text file**. This allows learners to have a structured reference as they progress through their learning journey.
